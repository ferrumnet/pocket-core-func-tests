# QA Testing Scope

The scope of these tests are limited to the following products:
- Pocket Core CLI
- Pocket Core RPCs

Justification:

After an investigation on how the users are interacting with Pocket Core, we came to the conclusion that from these two ways only the user would be able to receive a direct error or bug if existent, therefore, we need to make sure that Pocket Core quality levels are met via the CLI and the RPCs based on the best Quality Assurance Standards and tests.
